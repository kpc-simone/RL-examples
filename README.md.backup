Experiments to become familiar with reinforcement learning algorithms

[ex00_RW_tabular_td0:](https://github.com/kpc-simone/RL-examples/blob/main/ex00_RW_tabular_td0.ipynb) Learning the value function, $V(s)$, of a 1-dimensional environment.

[ex01_RW_ACtabular_td0:](https://github.com/kpc-simone/RL-examples/blob/main/ex01_RW_ACtabular_td0.ipynb) Actor-Critic agent learns to move within a 1-dimensional environment. This amounts to learning a policy function, $\Pi(s,a)$ indicating the desireability of action $a$ in state $s$. The TD0 learning rule is used again.
